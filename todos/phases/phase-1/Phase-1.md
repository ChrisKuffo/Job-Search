## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure

1. Set up project structure
   - Create directory structure as outlined in PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md
   - Initialize git repository
   - Create .gitignore file with appropriate entries for Python, Node.js, and project-specific files

2. Configure development environment
   - Set up Poetry for Python dependency management
     - Install Poetry globally or in a virtual environment
     - Initialize a new Poetry project with `poetry init`
     - Add initial Python dependencies to pyproject.toml
   - Create package.json for npm scripts and frontend dependencies
     - Initialize npm project with `npm init`
     - Add concurrently as a dev dependency with `npm install concurrently --save-dev`
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks
   - Set up MyPy for static type checking in Python
   - Create a .env file for environment variables and add it to .gitignore

3. Set up backend framework
   - Initialize FastAPI application
   - Set up Supabase client integration in the backend
   - Configure Supabase connection and authentication
   - Set up basic API structure (endpoints/, services/, etc.)
   - Create requirements.txt file using Poetry for non-Poetry environments

4. Set up frontend framework
   - Initialize Next.js application
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up React Query for state management and API calls

5. Implement basic CI/CD pipeline
   - Create GitHub Actions workflows for frontend and backend
   - Set up separate workflows for linting, testing, and building

6. Configure project-wide scripts
   - Set up npm scripts in the root package.json to use concurrently for running both frontend and backend
   - Create Poetry scripts for common backend tasks
   - Add scripts for Supabase migrations and seed data

7. Documentation setup
   - Create a comprehensive README.md file
   - Set up API documentation using tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc for FastAPI
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors

8. Docker setup (optional)
   - Create Dockerfile for backend
   - Create Dockerfile for frontend
   - Set up docker-compose.yml for easy local deployment

9. Local development environment
   - Set up Supabase local development environment
   - Configure CORS settings for local development
   - Create sample data scripts for easy Supabase seeding

10. Version control and branching strategy
    - Set up main/master branch protection rules
    - Create development branch
    - Define branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) and document it
