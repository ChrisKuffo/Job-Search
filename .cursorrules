- Implement Git for version control
- Apply ESLint & Prettier for code formatting
- Write tests using Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress
- Utilize MyPy for Python static type checking
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Use pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Employ concurrently for running multiple processes
- Implement SQL migrations for Supabase schema changes:
  - Use a migration tool compatible with Supabase (e.g., golang-migrate, sqitch)
  - Version control your migration scripts
  - Integrate database migrations into your CI/CD pipeline
  - Maintain a clear and chronological migration history

## Code Style and Structure:
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use type hints in Python and TypeScript for improved code quality
- Structure your project following the outlined directory structure
- Optimize for performance, considering both frontend and backend aspects
- For Supabase database design:
  - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for tables and columns
  - Implement proper indexing for frequently queried columns
  - Utilize Supabase's built-in authentication and authorization features
  - Design with scalability in mind, considering potential future data growth

## Key Features to Implement:
- AI-powered resume analysis and job matching
- Multi-platform job scraping with language detection
- Real-time data streaming and updates
- Interactive data visualizations
- User authentication and personalized experiences
- AI-powered interview preparation module
- Efficient database schema for storing user profiles, resumes, job listings, and matches
- Implement a system for easy application of database migrations to Supabase

## Supabase Database Management:
- Create SQL migration scripts for all schema changes
- Test migrations thoroughly in a development environment before applying to production
- Document each migration with clear descriptions of the changes and their purpose
- Consider using Supabase CLI for local development and migration management
- Implement a strategy for handling data migrations alongside schema changes when necessary
- Regularly backup the database before applying migrations

## Workflow for Managing Supabase Schema Changes:
- Establish a process for developers to propose and review database changes
- Integrate database migration steps in the deployment pipeline
- Develop strategies for rolling back migrations if issues are encountered in production

## Coding Guidelines:
- Follow best practices for each technology used in the project
- Focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and efficient application
- Prioritize user experience, performance, and the integration of AI capabilities throughout the application
- Provide clear comments and documentation, especially for database-related code and migration scripts
- Be prepared to explain your design decisions and suggest optimizations or alternative approaches when appropriate
