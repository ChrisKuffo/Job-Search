      "title": "Quick Start",
      "url": "https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/quickstart/",
      "content": "# Quick Start Guide 🚀\n\nWelcome to the Crawl4AI Quickstart Guide! In this tutorial, we'll walk you\nthrough the basic usage of Crawl4AI with a friendly and humorous tone. We'll\ncover everything from basic usage to advanced features like chunking and\nextraction strategies, all with the power of asynchronous programming. Let's\ndive in! 🌟\n\n## Getting Started 🛠️\n\nFirst, let's import the necessary modules and create an instance of\n`AsyncWebCrawler`. We'll use an async context manager, which handles the setup\nand teardown of the crawler for us.\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            # We'll add our crawling code here\n            pass\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Basic Usage\n\nSimply provide a URL and let Crawl4AI do the magic!\n\n    \n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\")\n            print(f\"Basic crawl result: {result.markdown[:500]}\")  # Print first 500 characters\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Taking Screenshots 📸\n\nLet's take a screenshot of the page!\n\n    \n    \n    import base64\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\", screenshot=True)\n            with open(\"screenshot.png\", \"wb\") as f:\n                f.write(base64.b64decode(result.screenshot))\n            print(\"Screenshot saved to 'screenshot.png'!\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Understanding Parameters 🧠\n\nBy default, Crawl4AI caches the results of your crawls. This means that\nsubsequent crawls of the same URL will be much faster! Let's see this in\naction.\n\n    \n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            # First crawl (caches the result)\n            result1 = await crawler.arun(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\")\n            print(f\"First crawl result: {result1.markdown[:100]}...\")\n    \n            # Force to crawl again\n            result2 = await crawler.arun(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\", bypass_cache=True)\n            print(f\"Second crawl result: {result2.markdown[:100]}...\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Adding a Chunking Strategy 🧩\n\nLet's add a chunking strategy: `RegexChunking`! This strategy splits the text\nbased on a given regex pattern.\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\",\n                chunking_strategy=RegexChunking(patterns=[\"\\n\\n\"])\n            )\n            print(f\"RegexChunking result: {result.extracted_content[:200]}...\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Adding an Extraction Strategy 🧠\n\nLet's get smarter with an extraction strategy: `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`!\nThis strategy extracts structured data from HTML using CSS selectors.\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n    import json\n    \n    async def main():\n        schema = {\n            \"name\": \"News Articles\",\n            \"baseSelector\": \"article.tease-card\",\n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"title\",\n                    \"selector\": \"h2\",\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"summary\",\n                    \"selector\": \"div.tease-card__info\",\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\",\n                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n            )\n            extracted_data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n            print(f\"Extracted {len(extracted_data)} articles\")\n            print(json.dumps(extracted_data[0], indent=2))\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Using LLMExtractionStrategy 🤖\n\nTime to bring in the big guns: `LLMExtractionStrategy`! This strategy uses a\nlarge language model to extract relevant information from the web page.\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy\n    import os\n    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n    \n    class OpenAIModelFee(BaseModel):\n        model_name: str = Field(..., description=\"Name of the OpenAI model.\")\n        input_fee: str = Field(..., description=\"Fee for input token for the OpenAI model.\")\n        output_fee: str = Field(..., description=\"Fee for output token for the OpenAI model.\")\n    \n    async def main():\n        if not os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):\n            print(\"OpenAI API key not found. Skipping this example.\")\n            return\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/\",\n                word_count_threshold=1,\n                extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(\n                    provider=\"openai/gpt-4o\",\n                    api_token=os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                    schema=OpenAIModelFee.schema(),\n                    extraction_type=\"schema\",\n                    instruction=\"\"\"From the crawled content, extract all mentioned model names along with their fees for input and output tokens. \n                    Do not miss any models in the entire content. One extracted model JSON format should look like this: \n                    {\"model_name\": \"GPT-4\", \"input_fee\": \"US$10.00 / 1M tokens\", \"output_fee\": \"US$30.00 / 1M tokens\"}.\"\"\",\n                ),\n                bypass_cache=True,\n            )\n            print(result.extracted_content)\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Interactive Extraction 🖱️\n\nLet's use JavaScript to interact with the page before extraction!\n\n    \n    \n    async def main():\n        js_code = \"\"\"\n        const loadMoreButton = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button')).find(button => button.textContent.includes('Load More'));\n        loadMoreButton && loadMoreButton.click();\n        \"\"\"\n    \n        wait_for = \"\"\"() => {\n            return Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('article.tease-card')).length > 10;\n        }\"\"\"\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\",\n                js_code=js_code,\n                wait_for=wait_for,\n                css_selector=\"article.tease-card\",\n                bypass_cache=True,\n            )\n            print(f\"JavaScript interaction result: {result.extracted_content[:500]}\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### Advanced Session-Based Crawling with Dynamic Content 🔄\n\nIn modern web applications, content is often loaded dynamically without\nchanging the URL. This is common in single-page applications (SPAs) or\nwebsites using infinite scrolling. Traditional crawling methods that rely on\nURL changes won't work here. That's where Crawl4AI's advanced session-based\ncrawling comes in handy!\n\nHere's what makes this approach powerful:\n\n  1. **Session Preservation** : By using a `session_id`, we can maintain the state of our crawling session across multiple interactions with the page. This is crucial for navigating through dynamically loaded content.\n\n  2. **Asynchronous JavaScript Execution** : We can execute custom JavaScript to trigger content loading or navigation. In this example, we'll click a \"Load More\" button to fetch the next page of commits.\n\n  3. **Dynamic Content Waiting** : The `wait_for` parameter allows us to specify a condition that must be met before considering the page load complete. This ensures we don't extract data before the new content is fully loaded.\n\nLet's see how this works with a real-world example: crawling multiple pages of\ncommits on a GitHub repository. The URL doesn't change as we load more\ncommits, so we'll use these advanced techniques to navigate and extract data.\n\n    \n    \n    import json\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            url = \"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commits/main\"\n            session_id = \"typescript_commits_session\"\n            all_commits = []\n    \n            js_next_page = \"\"\"\n            const button = document.querySelector('a[data-testid=\"pagination-next-button\"]');\n            if (button) button.click();\n            \"\"\"\n    \n            wait_for = \"\"\"() => {\n                const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0 h4');\n                if (commits.length === 0) return false;\n                const firstCommit = commits[0].textContent.trim();\n                return firstCommit !== window.lastCommit;\n            }\"\"\"\n    \n            schema = {\n                \"name\": \"Commit Extractor\",\n                \"baseSelector\": \"li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0\",\n                \"fields\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"title\",\n                        \"selector\": \"h4.markdown-title\",\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                        \"transform\": \"strip\",\n                    },\n                ],\n            }\n            extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n            for page in range(3):  # Crawl 3 pages\n                result = await crawler.arun(\n                    url=url,\n                    session_id=session_id,\n                    css_selector=\"li.Box-sc-g0xbh4-0\",\n                    extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                    js_code=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,\n                    wait_for=wait_for if page > 0 else None,\n                    js_only=page > 0,\n                    bypass_cache=True,\n                    headless=False,\n                )\n    \n                assert result.success, f\"Failed to crawl page {page + 1}\"\n    \n                commits = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n                all_commits.extend(commits)\n    \n                print(f\"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits\")\n    \n            await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)\n            print(f\"Successfully crawled {len(all_commits)} commits across 3 pages\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\nIn this example, we're crawling multiple pages of commits from a GitHub\nrepository. The URL doesn't change as we load more commits, so we use\nJavaScript to click the \"Load More\" button and a `wait_for` condition to\nensure the new content is loaded before extraction. This powerful combination\nallows us to navigate and extract data from complex, dynamically-loaded web\napplications with ease!\n\n## Congratulations! 🎉\n\nYou've made it through the Crawl4AI Quickstart Guide!

Fields to extract from each\nelement, each with its own CSS selector\n\nThis strategy is fast and efficient, as it doesn't rely on external services\nlike LLMs for extraction.\n\n## Example: Extracting Cryptocurrency Prices from Coinbase\n\nLet's look at an example that extracts cryptocurrency prices from the Coinbase\nexplore page.\n\n    \n    \n    import json\n    import asyncio\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor():\n        print(\"\\n--- Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy for Fast Structured Output ---\")\n    \n        # Define the extraction schema\n        schema = {\n            \"name\": \"Coinbase Crypto Prices\",\n            \"baseSelector\": \".cds-tableRow-t45thuk\",\n            \"fields\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"crypto\",\n                    \"selector\": \"td:nth-child(1) h2\",\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"symbol\",\n                    \"selector\": \"td:nth-child(1) p\",\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                },\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"price\",\n                    \"selector\": \"td:nth-child(2)\",\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n    \n        # Create the extraction strategy\n        extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n        # Use the AsyncWebCrawler with the extraction strategy\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://www.coinbase.com/explore\",\n                extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                bypass_cache=True,\n            )\n    \n            assert result.success, \"Failed to crawl the page\"\n    \n            # Parse the extracted content\n            crypto_prices = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n            print(f\"Successfully extracted {len(crypto_prices)} cryptocurrency prices\")\n            print(json.dumps(crypto_prices[0], indent=2))\n    \n        return crypto_prices\n    \n    # Run the async function\n    asyncio.run(extract_structured_data_using_css_extractor())\n    \n\n## Explanation of the Schema\n\nThe schema defines how to extract the data:\n\n  * `name`: A descriptive name for the extraction task.\n  * `baseSelector`: The CSS selector for the repeating elements (in this case, table rows).\n  * `fields`: An array of fields to extract from each element:\n  * `name`: The name to give the extracted data.\n  * `selector`: The CSS selector to find the specific data within the base element.\n  * `type`: The type of data to extract (usually \"text\" for textual content).\n\n## Advantages of JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n\n  1. **Speed** : CSS selectors are fast to execute, making this method efficient for large datasets.\n  2. **Precision** : You can target exactly the elements you need.\n  3. **Structured Output** : The result is already structured as JSON, ready for further processing.\n  4. **No External Dependencies** : Unlike LLM-based strategies, this doesn't require any API calls to external services.\n\n## Tips for Using JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n\n  1. **Inspect the Page** : Use browser developer tools to identify the correct CSS selectors.\n  2. **Test Selectors** : Verify your selectors in the browser console before using them in the script.\n  3. **Handle Dynamic Content** : If the page uses JavaScript to load content, you may need to combine this with JS execution (see the Advanced Usage section).\n  4. **Error Handling** : Always check the `result.success` flag and handle potential failures.\n\n## Advanced Usage: Combining with JavaScript Execution\n\nFor pages that load data dynamically, you can combine the\n`JsonCssExtractionStrategy` with JavaScript execution:\n\n    \n    \n    async def extract_dynamic_structured_data():\n        schema = {\n            \"name\": \"Dynamic Crypto Prices\",\n            \"baseSelector\": \".crypto-row\",\n            \"fields\": [\n                {\"name\": \"name\", \"selector\": \".crypto-name\", \"type\": \"text\"},\n                {\"name\": \"price\", \"selector\": \".crypto-price\", \"type\": \"text\"},\n            ]\n        }\n    \n        js_code = \"\"\"\n        window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));  // Wait for 2 seconds\n        \"\"\"\n    \n        extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://example.com/crypto-prices\",\n                extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                js_code=js_code,\n                wait_for=\".crypto-row:nth-child(20)\",  # Wait for 20 rows to load\n                bypass_cache=True,\n            )\n    \n            crypto_data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n            print(f\"Extracted {len(crypto_data)} cryptocurrency entries\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(extract_dynamic_structured_data())\n    \n\nThis advanced example demonstrates how to: 1\\. Execute JavaScript to trigger\ndynamic content loading. 2\\. Wait for a specific condition (20 rows loaded)\nbefore extraction. 3\\. Extract data from the dynamically loaded content.\n\nBy mastering the `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`, you can efficiently extract\nstructured data from a wide variety of web pages, making it a valuable tool in\nyour web scraping toolkit.\n\nFor more details on schema definitions and advanced extraction strategies,\ncheck out the[Advanced\nJsonCssExtraction](../../full_details/advanced_jsoncss_extraction/).\n\n"

Just pass the correct model name and API token:\n\n    \n    \n    extraction_strategy=LLMExtractionStrategy(\n        provider=\"your_llm_provider/model_name\",\n        api_token=\"your_api_token\",\n        instruction=\"Your extraction instruction\"\n    )\n    \n\nThis flexibility allows you to integrate with various LLM providers and tailor\nthe extraction process to your specific needs.\n\n## Error Handling and Retries\n\nWhen working with external LLM APIs, it's important to handle potential errors\nand implement retry logic. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential\n    \n    class LLMExtractionError(Exception):\n        pass\n    \n    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))\n    async def extract_with_retry(crawler, url, extraction_strategy):\n        try:\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy, bypass_cache=True)\n            return json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n        except Exception as e:\n            raise LLMExtractionError(f\"Failed to extract content: {str(e)}\")\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            try:\n                content = await extract_with_retry(\n                    crawler,\n                    \"https://www.example.com\",\n                    LLMExtractionStrategy(\n                        provider=\"openai/gpt-4o\",\n                        api_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'),\n                        instruction=\"Extract and summarize main points\"\n                    )\n                )\n                print(\"Extracted content:\", content)\n            except LLMExtractionError as e:\n                print(f\"Extraction failed after retries: {e}\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\nThis example uses the `tenacity` library to implement a retry mechanism with\nexponential backoff, which can help handle temporary failures or rate limiting\nfrom the LLM API.\n\n"

It sets up the browser context, logs in to a website, and adds a custom cookie.\n  * `before_goto`: This hook is called right before Playwright navigates to the URL. It adds custom HTTP headers.\n  * `after_goto`: This hook is called after Playwright navigates to the URL. It logs the current URL.\n  * `on_execution_started`: This hook is called after any custom JavaScript is executed. It performs additional JavaScript actions.\n  * `before_return_html`: This hook is called before returning the HTML content. It logs the length of the HTML content.\n\n### Additional Ideas\n\n  * **Handling authentication** : Use the `on_browser_created` hook to handle login processes or set authentication tokens.\n  * **Dynamic header modification** : Modify headers based on the target URL or other conditions in the `before_goto` hook.\n  * **Content verification** : Use the `after_goto` hook to verify that the expected content is present on the page.\n  * **Custom JavaScript injection** : Inject and execute custom JavaScript using the `on_execution_started` hook.\n  * **Content preprocessing** : Modify or analyze the HTML content in the `before_return_html` hook before it's returned.\n\nBy using these hooks, you can customize the behavior of the AsyncWebCrawler to\nsuit your specific needs, including handling authentication, modifying\nrequests, and preprocessing content.\n\n"

      "content": "# Summarization Example with AsyncWebCrawler\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use Crawl4AI's `AsyncWebCrawler` to extract a\nsummary from a web page asynchronously. The goal is to obtain the title, a\ndetailed summary, a brief summary, and a list of keywords from the given page.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n  1. **Import Necessary Modules**\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n`python import os import json import asyncio from crawl4ai import\nAsyncWebCrawler from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy\nfrom crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking from pydantic import\nBaseModel, Field`\n\n  2. **Define the URL to be Crawled**\n\nSet the URL of the web page you want to summarize:\n\n`python url =\n'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unclecode.groqopilot'`\n\n  3. **Define the Data Model**\n\nUse Pydantic to define the structure of the extracted data:\n\n`python class PageSummary(BaseModel): title: str = Field(...,\ndescription=\"Title of the page.\") summary: str = Field(...,\ndescription=\"Summary of the page.\") brief_summary: str = Field(...,\ndescription=\"Brief summary of the page.\") keywords: list = Field(...,\ndescription=\"Keywords assigned to the page.\")`\n\n  4. **Create the Extraction Strategy**\n\nSet up the `LLMExtractionStrategy` with the necessary parameters:\n\n`python extraction_strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy( provider=\"openai/gpt-4o\",\napi_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'), schema=PageSummary.model_json_schema(),\nextraction_type=\"schema\", apply_chunking=False, instruction=( \"From the\ncrawled content, extract the following details: \" \"1. Title of the page \" \"2.\nSummary of the page, which is a detailed summary \" \"3. Brief summary of the\npage, which is a paragraph text \" \"4. Keywords assigned to the page, which is\na list of keywords. \" 'The extracted JSON format should look like this: ' '{\n\"title\": \"Page Title\", \"summary\": \"Detailed summary of the page.\", '\n'\"brief_summary\": \"Brief summary in a paragraph.\", \"keywords\": [\"keyword1\",\n\"keyword2\", \"keyword3\"] }' ) )`\n\n  5. **Define the Async Crawl Function**\n\nCreate an asynchronous function to run the crawler:\n\n`python async def crawl_and_summarize(url): async with\nAsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler: result = await crawler.arun(\nurl=url, word_count_threshold=1, extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\nchunking_strategy=RegexChunking(), bypass_cache=True, ) return result`\n\n  6. **Run the Crawler and Process Results**\n\nUse asyncio to run the crawler and process the results:\n\n```python async def main(): result = await crawl_and_summarize(url)\n\n    \n        if result.success:\n        page_summary = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n        print(\"Extracted Page Summary:\")\n        print(json.dumps(page_summary, indent=2))\n    \n        # Save the extracted data\n        with open(\".data/page_summary.json\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n            json.dump(page_summary, f, indent=2)\n        print(\"Page summary saved to .data/page_summary.json\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to crawl and summarize the page. Error: {result.error_message}\")\n    \n\n# Run the async main function\n\nasyncio.run(main()) ```\n\n## Explanation\n\n  * **Importing Modules** : We import the necessary modules, including `AsyncWebCrawler` and `LLMExtractionStrategy` from Crawl4AI.\n  * **URL Definition** : We set the URL of the web page to crawl and summarize.\n  * **Data Model Definition** : We define the structure of the data to extract using Pydantic's `BaseModel`.\n  * **Extraction Strategy Setup** : We create an instance of `LLMExtractionStrategy` with the schema and detailed instructions for the extraction process.\n  * **Async Crawl Function** : We define an asynchronous function `crawl_and_summarize` that uses `AsyncWebCrawler` to perform the crawling and extraction.\n  * **Main Execution** : In the `main` function, we run the crawler, process the results, and save the extracted data.\n\n## Advanced Usage: Crawling Multiple URLs\n\nTo demonstrate the power of `AsyncWebCrawler`, here's how you can summarize\nmultiple pages concurrently:\n\n    \n    \n    async def crawl_multiple_urls(urls):\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            tasks = [crawler.arun(\n                url=url,\n                word_count_threshold=1,\n                extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                chunking_strategy=RegexChunking(),\n                bypass_cache=True\n            ) for url in urls]\n            results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        return results\n    \n    async def main():\n        urls = [\n            'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unclecode.groqopilot',\n            'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot',\n            'https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python'\n        ]\n        results = await crawl_multiple_urls(urls)\n    \n        for i, result in enumerate(results):\n            if result.success:\n                page_summary = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n                print(f\"\\nSummary for URL {i+1}:\")\n                print(json.dumps(page_summary, indent=2))\n            else:\n                print(f\"\\nFailed to summarize URL {i+1}. Error: {result.error_message}\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\nThis advanced example shows how to use `AsyncWebCrawler` to efficiently\nsummarize multiple web pages concurrently, significantly reducing the total\nprocessing time compared to sequential crawling.\n\nBy leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of Crawl4AI, you can perform\nadvanced web crawling and data extraction tasks with improved efficiency and\nscalability.\n\n"

      "url": "https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/full_details/session_based_crawling/",
      "content": "# Session-Based Crawling for Dynamic Content\n\nIn modern web applications, content is often loaded dynamically without\nchanging the URL. Examples include \"Load More\" buttons, infinite scrolling, or\npaginated content that updates via JavaScript. To effectively crawl such\nwebsites, Crawl4AI provides powerful session-based crawling capabilities.\n\nThis guide will explore advanced techniques for crawling dynamic content using\nCrawl4AI's session management features.\n\n## Understanding Session-Based Crawling\n\nSession-based crawling allows you to maintain a persistent browser session\nacross multiple requests. This is crucial when:\n\n  1. The content changes dynamically without URL changes\n  2. You need to interact with the page (e.g., clicking buttons) between requests\n  3. The site requires authentication or maintains state across pages\n\nCrawl4AI's `AsyncWebCrawler` class supports session-based crawling through the\n`session_id` parameter and related methods.\n\n## Basic Concepts\n\nBefore diving into examples, let's review some key concepts:\n\n  * **Session ID** : A unique identifier for a browsing session. Use the same `session_id` across multiple `arun` calls to maintain state.\n  * **JavaScript Execution** : Use the `js_code` parameter to execute JavaScript on the page, such as clicking a \"Load More\" button.\n  * **CSS Selectors** : Use these to target specific elements for extraction or interaction.\n  * **Extraction Strategy** : Define how to extract structured data from the page.\n  * **Wait Conditions** : Specify conditions to wait for before considering the page loaded.\n\n## Example 1: Basic Session-Based Crawling\n\nLet's start with a basic example of session-based crawling:\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    \n    async def basic_session_crawl():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            session_id = \"my_session\"\n            url = \"https://example.com/dynamic-content\"\n    \n            for page in range(3):\n                result = await crawler.arun(\n                    url=url,\n                    session_id=session_id,\n                    js_code=\"document.querySelector('.load-more-button').click();\" if page > 0 else None,\n                    css_selector=\".content-item\",\n                    bypass_cache=True\n                )\n    \n                print(f\"Page {page + 1}: Found {result.extracted_content.count('.content-item')} items\")\n    \n            await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)\n    \n    asyncio.run(basic_session_crawl())\n    \n\nThis example demonstrates: 1\\. Using a consistent `session_id` across multiple\n`arun` calls 2\\. Executing JavaScript to load more content after the first\npage 3\\. Using a CSS selector to extract specific content 4\\. Properly closing\nthe session after crawling\n\n## Advanced Technique 1: Custom Execution Hooks\n\nCrawl4AI allows you to set custom hooks that execute at different stages of\nthe crawling process. This is particularly useful for handling complex loading\nscenarios.\n\nHere's an example that waits for new content to appear before proceeding:\n\n    \n    \n    async def advanced_session_crawl_with_hooks():\n        first_commit = \"\"\n    \n        async def on_execution_started(page):\n            nonlocal first_commit\n            try:\n                while True:\n                    await page.wait_for_selector(\"li.commit-item h4\")\n                    commit = await page.query_selector(\"li.commit-item h4\")\n                    commit = await commit.evaluate(\"(element) => element.textContent\")\n                    commit = commit.strip()\n                    if commit and commit != first_commit:\n                        first_commit = commit\n                        break\n                    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Warning: New content didn't appear after JavaScript execution: {e}\")\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            crawler.crawler_strategy.set_hook(\"on_execution_started\", on_execution_started)\n    \n            url = \"https://github.com/example/repo/commits/main\"\n            session_id = \"commit_session\"\n            all_commits = []\n    \n            js_next_page = \"\"\"\n            const button = document.querySelector('a.pagination-next');\n            if (button) button.click();\n            \"\"\"\n    \n            for page in range(3):\n                result = await crawler.arun(\n                    url=url,\n                    session_id=session_id,\n                    css_selector=\"li.commit-item\",\n                    js_code=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,\n                    bypass_cache=True,\n                    js_only=page > 0\n                )\n    \n                commits = result.extracted_content.select(\"li.commit-item\")\n                all_commits.extend(commits)\n                print(f\"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits\")\n    \n            await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)\n            print(f\"Successfully crawled {len(all_commits)} commits across 3 pages\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(advanced_session_crawl_with_hooks())\n    \n\nThis technique uses a custom `on_execution_started` hook to ensure new content\nhas loaded before proceeding to the next step.\n\n## Advanced Technique 2: Integrated JavaScript Execution and Waiting\n\nInstead of using separate hooks, you can integrate the waiting logic directly\ninto your JavaScript execution. This approach can be more concise and easier\nto manage for some scenarios.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    \n    \n    async def integrated_js_and_wait_crawl():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            url = \"https://github.com/example/repo/commits/main\"\n            session_id = \"integrated_session\"\n            all_commits = []\n    \n            js_next_page_and_wait = \"\"\"\n            (async () => {\n                const getCurrentCommit = () => {\n                    const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.commit-item h4');\n                    return commits.length > 0 ? commits[0].textContent.trim() : null;\n                };\n    \n                const initialCommit = getCurrentCommit();\n                const button = document.querySelector('a.pagination-next');\n                if (button) button.click();\n    \n                while (true) {\n                    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n                    const newCommit = getCurrentCommit();\n                    if (newCommit && newCommit !== initialCommit) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            })();\n            \"\"\"\n    \n            schema = {\n                \"name\": \"Commit Extractor\",\n                \"baseSelector\": \"li.commit-item\",\n                \"fields\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"title\",\n                        \"selector\": \"h4.commit-title\",\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                        \"transform\": \"strip\",\n                    },\n                ],\n            }\n            extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n            for page in range(3):\n                result = await crawler.arun(\n                    url=url,\n                    session_id=session_id,\n                    css_selector=\"li.commit-item\",\n                    extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                    js_code=js_next_page_and_wait if page > 0 else None,\n                    js_only=page > 0,\n                    bypass_cache=True\n                )\n    \n                commits = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n                all_commits.extend(commits)\n                print(f\"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits\")\n    \n            await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)\n            print(f\"Successfully crawled {len(all_commits)} commits across 3 pages\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(integrated_js_and_wait_crawl())\n    \n\nThis approach combines the JavaScript for clicking the \"next\" button and\nwaiting for new content to load into a single script.\n\n## Advanced Technique 3: Using the `wait_for` Parameter\n\nCrawl4AI provides a `wait_for` parameter that allows you to specify a\ncondition to wait for before considering the page fully loaded. This can be\nparticularly useful for dynamic content.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    \n    \n    async def wait_for_parameter_crawl():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            url = \"https://github.com/example/repo/commits/main\"\n            session_id = \"wait_for_session\"\n            all_commits = []\n    \n            js_next_page = \"\"\"\n            const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.commit-item h4');\n            if (commits.length > 0) {\n                window.lastCommit = commits[0].textContent.trim();\n            }\n            const button = document.querySelector('a.pagination-next');\n            if (button) button.click();\n            \"\"\"\n    \n            wait_for = \"\"\"() => {\n                const commits = document.querySelectorAll('li.commit-item h4');\n                if (commits.length === 0) return false;\n                const firstCommit = commits[0].textContent.trim();\n                return firstCommit !== window.lastCommit;\n            }\"\"\"\n    \n            schema = {\n                \"name\": \"Commit Extractor\",\n                \"baseSelector\": \"li.commit-item\",\n                \"fields\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"title\",\n                        \"selector\": \"h4.commit-title\",\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                        \"transform\": \"strip\",\n                    },\n                ],\n            }\n            extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n            for page in range(3):\n                result = await crawler.arun(\n                    url=url,\n                    session_id=session_id,\n                    css_selector=\"li.commit-item\",\n                    extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                    js_code=js_next_page if page > 0 else None,\n                    wait_for=wait_for if page > 0 else None,\n                    js_only=page > 0,\n                    bypass_cache=True\n                )\n    \n                commits = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n                all_commits.extend(commits)\n                print(f\"Page {page + 1}: Found {len(commits)} commits\")\n    \n            await crawler.crawler_strategy.kill_session(session_id)\n            print(f\"Successfully crawled {len(all_commits)} commits across 3 pages\")\n    \n    asyncio.run(wait_for_parameter_crawl())\n    \n\nThis technique separates the JavaScript execution (clicking the \"next\" button)\nfrom the waiting condition, providing more flexibility and clarity in some\nscenarios.\n\n## Best Practices for Session-Based Crawling\n\n  1. **Use Unique Session IDs** : Ensure each crawling session has a unique `session_id` to prevent conflicts.\n  2. **Close Sessions** : Always close sessions using `kill_session` when you're done to free up resources.\n  3. **Handle Errors** : Implement proper error handling to deal with unexpected situations during crawling.\n  4. **Respect Website Terms** : Ensure your crawling adheres to the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.\n  5. **Implement Delays** : Add appropriate delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the target server.\n  6. **Use Extraction Strategies** : Leverage `JsonCssExtractionStrategy` or other extraction strategies for structured data extraction.\n  7. **Optimize JavaScript** : Keep your JavaScript execution concise and efficient to improve crawling speed.\n  8. **Monitor Performance** : Keep an eye on memory usage and crawling speed, especially for long-running sessions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSession-based crawling with Crawl4AI provides powerful capabilities for\nhandling dynamic content and complex web applications. By leveraging session\nmanagement, JavaScript execution, and waiting strategies, you can effectively\ncrawl and extract data from a wide range of modern websites.\n\nRemember to use these techniques responsibly and in compliance with website\npolicies and ethical web scraping practices.\n\nFor more advanced usage and API details, refer to the Crawl4AI API\ndocumentation.\n\n"

      "title": "Advanced Features",
      "url": "https://crawl4ai.com/mkdocs/full_details/advanced_features/",
      "content": "# Advanced Features\n\nCrawl4AI offers a range of advanced features that allow you to fine-tune your\nweb crawling and data extraction process. This section will cover some of\nthese advanced features, including taking screenshots, extracting media and\nlinks, customizing the user agent, using custom hooks, and leveraging CSS\nselectors.\n\n## Taking Screenshots 📸\n\nOne of the cool features of Crawl4AI is the ability to take screenshots of the\nweb pages you're crawling. This can be particularly useful for visual\nverification or for capturing the state of dynamic content.\n\nHere's how you can take a screenshot:\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler\n    import base64\n    \n    # Create the WebCrawler instance\n    crawler = WebCrawler()\n    crawler.warmup()\n    \n    # Run the crawler with the screenshot parameter\n    result = crawler.run(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\", screenshot=True)\n    \n    # Save the screenshot to a file\n    with open(\"screenshot.png\", \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(base64.b64decode(result.screenshot))\n    \n    print(\"Screenshot saved to 'screenshot.png'!\")\n    \n\nIn this example, we create a `WebCrawler` instance, warm it up, and then run\nit with the `screenshot` parameter set to `True`. The screenshot is saved as a\nbase64 encoded string in the result, which we then decode and save as a PNG\nfile.\n\n## Extracting Media and Links 🎨🔗\n\nCrawl4AI can extract all media tags (images, audio, and video) and links (both\ninternal and external) from a web page. This feature is useful for collecting\nmultimedia content or analyzing link structures.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler\n    \n    # Create the WebCrawler instance\n    crawler = WebCrawler()\n    crawler.warmup()\n    \n    # Run the crawler\n    result = crawler.run(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\")\n    \n    print(\"Extracted media:\", result.media)\n    print(\"Extracted links:\", result.links)\n    \n\nIn this example, the `result` object contains dictionaries for media and\nlinks, which you can access and use as needed.\n\n## Customizing the User Agent 🕵️‍♂️\n\nCrawl4AI allows you to set a custom user agent for your HTTP requests. This\ncan help you avoid detection by web servers or simulate different browsing\nenvironments.\n\nHere's how to set a custom user agent:\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler\n    \n    # Create the WebCrawler instance\n    crawler = WebCrawler()\n    crawler.warmup()\n    \n    # Run the crawler with a custom user agent\n    result = crawler.run(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\", user_agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MyCrawler/1.0)\")\n    \n    print(\"Crawl result:\", result)\n    \n\nIn this example, we specify a custom user agent string when running the\ncrawler.\n\n## Using Custom Hooks 🪝\n\nHooks are a powerful feature in Crawl4AI that allow you to customize the\ncrawling process at various stages. You can define hooks for actions such as\ndriver initialization, before and after URL fetching, and before returning the\nHTML.\n\nHere's an example of using hooks:\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler\n    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n    \n    # Define the hooks\n    def on_driver_created(driver):\n        driver.maximize_window()\n        driver.get('https://example.com/login')\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.NAME, 'username'))).send_keys('testuser')\n        driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'password').send_keys('password123')\n        driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'login').click()\n        return driver\n    \n    def before_get_url(driver):\n        driver.execute_cdp_cmd('Network.setExtraHTTPHeaders', {'headers': {'X-Test-Header': 'test'}})\n        return driver\n    \n    # Create the WebCrawler instance\n    crawler = WebCrawler()\n    crawler.warmup()\n    \n    # Set the hooks\n    crawler.set_hook('on_driver_created', on_driver_created)\n    crawler.set_hook('before_get_url', before_get_url)\n    \n    # Run the crawler\n    result = crawler.run(url=\"https://example.com\")\n    \n    print(\"Crawl result:\", result)\n    \n\nIn this example, we define hooks to handle driver initialization and custom\nheaders before fetching the URL.\n\n## Using CSS Selectors 🎯\n\nCSS selectors allow you to target specific elements on a web page for\nextraction. This can be useful for scraping structured content, such as\narticles or product details.\n\nHere's an example of using a CSS selector:\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai import WebCrawler\n    \n    # Create the WebCrawler instance\n    crawler = WebCrawler()\n    crawler.warmup()\n    \n    # Run the crawler with a CSS selector to extract only H2 tags\n    result = crawler.run(url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\", css_selector=\"h2\")\n    \n    print(\"Extracted H2 tags:\", result.extracted_content)\n    \n\nIn this example, we use the `css_selector` parameter to extract only the H2\ntags from the web page.\n\n* * *\n\nWith these advanced features, you can leverage Crawl4AI to perform\nsophisticated web crawling and data extraction tasks. Whether you need to take\nscreenshots, extract specific elements, customize the crawling process, or set\ncustom headers, Crawl4AI provides the flexibility and power to meet your\nneeds. Happy crawling! 🕷️🚀\n\n"

      "content": "# Advanced Usage of JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n\nWhile the basic usage of JsonCssExtractionStrategy is powerful for simple\nstructures, its true potential shines when dealing with complex, nested HTML\nstructures. This section will explore advanced usage scenarios, demonstrating\nhow to extract nested objects, lists, and nested lists.\n\n## Hypothetical Website Example\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical e-commerce website that displays product\ncategories, each containing multiple products. Each product has details,\nreviews, and related items. This complex structure will allow us to\ndemonstrate various advanced features of JsonCssExtractionStrategy.\n\nAssume the HTML structure looks something like this:\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"category\">\n      <h2 class=\"category-name\">Electronics</h2>\n      <div class=\"product\">\n        <h3 class=\"product-name\">Smartphone X</h3>\n        <p

class=\"product-features\">\n          <li>5G capable</li>\n          <li>6.5\" OLED screen</li>\n          <li>128GB storage</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div class=\"product-reviews\">\n          <div class=\"review\">\n            <span class=\"reviewer\">John D.</span>\n            <span class=\"rating\">4.5</span>\n            <p class=\"review-text\">Great phone, love the camera!</p>\n

   </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <!-- More products... -->\n    </div>\n    \n\nNow, let's create a schema to extract this complex structure:\n\n    \n    \n    schema = {\n        \"name\": \"E-commerce Product Catalog\",\n        \"baseSelector\": \"div.category\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"category_name\",\n

           ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\nThis schema demonstrates several advanced features:\n\n  1. **Nested Objects** : The `details` field is a nested object within each product.\n  2. **Simple Lists** : The `features` field is a simple list of text items.\n  3. **Nested Lists** : The `products` field is a nested list, where each item is a complex object.\n  4. **Lists of Objects** : The `reviews` and `related_products` fields are lists of objects.\n\nLet's break down the key concepts:\n\n### Nested Objects\n\nTo create a nested object, use `\"type\": \"nested\"` and provide a `fields` array\nfor the nested structure:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        \"name\": \"details\",\n        \"selector\": \"div.product-details\",\n        \"type\": \"nested\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"brand\",\n                \"selector\": \"span.brand\",\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"model\",\n                \"selector\": \"span.model\",\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\n### Simple Lists\n\nFor a simple list of identical items, use `\"type\": \"list\"`:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        \"name\": \"features\",\n        \"selector\": \"ul.product-features li\",\n        \"type\": \"list\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"feature\",\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\n### Nested Lists\n\nFor a list of complex objects, use `\"type\": \"nested_list\"`:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        \"name\": \"products\",\n        \"selector\": \"div.product\",\n        \"type\": \"nested_list\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            // ... fields for each product\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\n### Lists of Objects\n\nSimilar to nested lists, but typically used for simpler objects within the\nlist:\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        \"name\": \"related_products\",\n        \"selector\": \"ul.related-products li\",\n        \"type\": \"list\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"name\",\n                \"selector\": \"span.related-name\",\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"price\",\n                \"selector\": \"span.related-price\",\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    \n\n## Using the Advanced Schema\n\nTo use this advanced schema with AsyncWebCrawler:\n\n    \n    \n    import json\n    import asyncio\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def extract_complex_product_data():\n        extraction_strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            result = await crawler.arun(\n                url=\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/githubusercontent/2d7b8ba3cd8ab6cf3c8da771ddb36878/raw/1ae2f90c6861ce7dd84cc50d3df9920dee5e1fd2/sample_ecommerce.html\",\n                extraction_strategy=extraction_strategy,\n                bypass_cache=True,\n            )\n    \n            assert result.success, \"Failed to crawl the page\"\n    \n            product_data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n            print(json.dumps(product_data, indent=2))\n    \n    asyncio.run(extract_complex_product_data())\n    \n\nThis will produce a structured JSON output that captures the complex hierarchy\nof the product catalog, including nested objects, lists, and nested lists.\n\n## Tips for Advanced Usage\n\n  1. **Start Simple** : Begin with a basic schema and gradually add complexity.\n  2. **Test Incrementally** : Test each part of your schema separately before combining them.\n  3. **Use Chrome DevTools** : The Element Inspector is invaluable for identifying the correct selectors.\n  4. **Handle Missing Data** : Use the `default` key in your field definitions to handle cases where data might be missing.\n  5. **Leverage Transforms** : Use the `transform` key to clean or format extracted data (e.g., converting prices to numbers).\n  6. **Consider Performance** : Very complex schemas might slow down extraction. Balance complexity with performance needs.\n\nBy mastering these advanced techniques, you can use JsonCssExtractionStrategy\nto extract highly structured data from even the most complex web pages, making\nit a powerful tool for web scraping and data analysis tasks.\n\n"

      "content": "## Chunking Strategies 📚\n\nCrawl4AI provides several powerful chunking strategies to divide text into\nmanageable parts for further processing. Each strategy has unique\ncharacteristics and is suitable for different scenarios. Let's explore them\none by one.\n\n### RegexChunking\n\n`RegexChunking` splits text using regular expressions. This is ideal for\ncreating chunks based on specific patterns like paragraphs or sentences.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Great for structured text with consistent delimiters.\n  * Suitable for documents where specific patterns (e.g., double newlines, periods) indicate logical chunks.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `patterns` (list, optional): Regular expressions used to split the text. Default is to split by double newlines (`['\\n\\n']`).\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import RegexChunking\n    \n    # Define patterns for splitting text\n    patterns = [r'\\n\\n', r'\\. ']\n    chunker = RegexChunking(patterns=patterns)\n    \n    # Sample text\n    text = \"This is a sample text. It will be split into chunks.\\n\\nThis is another paragraph.\"\n    \n    # Chunk the text\n    chunks = chunker.chunk(text)\n    print(chunks)\n    \n\n### NlpSentenceChunking\n\n`NlpSentenceChunking` uses NLP models to split text into sentences, ensuring\naccurate sentence boundaries.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Ideal for texts where sentence boundaries are crucial.\n  * Useful for creating chunks that preserve grammatical structures.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * None.\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import NlpSentenceChunking\n    \n    chunker = NlpSentenceChunking()\n    \n    # Sample text\n    text = \"This is a sample text. It will be split into sentences. Here's another sentence.\"\n    \n    # Chunk the text\n    chunks = chunker.chunk(text)\n    print(chunks)\n    \n\n### TopicSegmentationChunking\n\n`TopicSegmentationChunking` employs the TextTiling algorithm to segment text\ninto topic-based chunks. This method identifies thematic boundaries.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Perfect for long documents with distinct topics.\n  * Useful when preserving topic continuity is more important than maintaining text order.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `num_keywords` (int, optional): Number of keywords for each topic segment. Default is `3`.\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import TopicSegmentationChunking\n    \n    chunker = TopicSegmentationChunking(num_keywords=3)\n    \n    # Sample text\n    text = \"This document contains several topics. Topic one discusses AI. Topic two covers machine learning.\"\n    \n    # Chunk the text\n    chunks = chunker.chunk(text)\n    print(chunks)\n    \n\n### FixedLengthWordChunking\n\n`FixedLengthWordChunking` splits text into chunks based on a fixed number of\nwords. This ensures each chunk has approximately the same length.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Suitable for processing large texts where uniform chunk size is important.\n  * Useful when the number of words per chunk needs to be controlled.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `chunk_size` (int, optional): Number of words per chunk. Default is `100`.\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import FixedLengthWordChunking\n    \n    chunker = FixedLengthWordChunking(chunk_size=10)\n    \n    # Sample text\n    text = \"This is a sample text. It will be split into chunks of fixed length.\"\n    \n    # Chunk the text\n    chunks = chunker.chunk(text)\n    print(chunks)\n    \n\n### SlidingWindowChunking\n\n`SlidingWindowChunking` uses a sliding window approach to create overlapping\nchunks. Each chunk has a fixed length, and the window slides by a specified\nstep size.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Ideal for creating overlapping chunks to preserve context.\n  * Useful for tasks where context from adjacent chunks is needed.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `window_size` (int, optional): Number of words in each chunk. Default is `100`.\n  * `step` (int, optional): Number of words to slide the window. Default is `50`.\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    from crawl4ai.chunking_strategy import SlidingWindowChunking\n    \n    chunker = SlidingWindowChunking(window_size=10, step=5)\n    \n    # Sample text\n    text = \"This is a sample text. It will be split using a sliding window approach to preserve context.\"\n    \n    # Chunk the text\n    chunks = chunker.chunk(text)\n    print(chunks)\n    \n\nWith these chunking strategies, you can choose the best method to divide your\ntext based on your specific needs. Whether you need precise sentence\nboundaries, topic-based segmentation, or uniform chunk sizes, Crawl4AI has you\ncovered. Happy chunking! 📝✨\n\n"

      "content": "## Extraction Strategies 🧠\n\nCrawl4AI offers powerful extraction strategies to derive meaningful\ninformation from web content. Let's dive into three of the most important\nstrategies: `CosineStrategy`, `LLMExtractionStrategy`, and the new\n`JsonCssExtractionStrategy`.\n\n### LLMExtractionStrategy\n\n`LLMExtractionStrategy` leverages a Language Model (LLM) to extract meaningful\ncontent from HTML. This strategy uses an external provider for LLM completions\nto perform extraction based on instructions.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Suitable for complex extraction tasks requiring nuanced understanding.\n  * Ideal for scenarios where detailed instructions can guide the extraction process.\n  * Perfect for extracting specific types of information or content with precise guidelines.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `provider` (str, optional): Provider for language model completions (e.g., openai/gpt-4). Default is `DEFAULT_PROVIDER`.\n  * `api_token` (str, optional): API token for the provider. If not provided, it will try to load from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n  * `instruction` (str, optional): Instructions to guide the LLM on how to perform the extraction. Default is `None`.\n\n#### Example Without Instructions\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    import os\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            # Define extraction strategy without instructions\n            strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(\n                provider='openai',\n                api_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\n            )\n    \n            # Sample URL\n            url = \"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\"\n    \n            # Run the crawler with the extraction strategy\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, extraction_strategy=strategy)\n            print(result.extracted_content)\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n#### Example With Instructions\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    import os\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import LLMExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            # Define extraction strategy with instructions\n            strategy = LLMExtractionStrategy(\n                provider='openai',\n                api_token=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'),\n                instruction=\"Extract only financial news and summarize key points.\"\n            )\n    \n            # Sample URL\n            url = \"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\"\n    \n            # Run the crawler with the extraction strategy\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, extraction_strategy=strategy)\n            print(result.extracted_content)\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n### JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n\n`JsonCssExtractionStrategy` is a powerful tool for extracting structured data\nfrom HTML using CSS selectors. It allows you to define a schema that maps CSS\nselectors to specific fields, enabling precise and efficient data extraction.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Ideal for extracting structured data from websites with consistent HTML structures.\n  * Perfect for scenarios where you need to extract specific elements or attributes from a webpage.\n  * Suitable for creating datasets from web pages with tabular or list-based information.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `schema` (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary defining the extraction schema, including base selector and field definitions.\n\n#### Example\n\n    \n    \n    import asyncio\n    import json\n    from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler\n    from crawl4ai.extraction_strategy import JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n    \n    async def main():\n        async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:\n            # Define the extraction schema\n            schema = {\n                \"name\": \"News Articles\",\n                \"baseSelector\": \"article.tease-card\",\n                \"fields\": [\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"title\",\n                        \"selector\": \"h2\",\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"summary\",\n                        \"selector\": \"div.tease-card__info\",\n                        \"type\": \"text\",\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"name\": \"link\",\n                        \"selector\": \"a\",\n                        \"type\": \"attribute\",\n                        \"attribute\": \"href\"\n                    }\n                ],\n            }\n    \n            # Create the extraction strategy\n            strategy = JsonCssExtractionStrategy(schema, verbose=True)\n    \n            # Sample URL\n            url = \"https://www.nbcnews.com/business\"\n    \n            # Run the crawler with the extraction strategy\n            result = await crawler.arun(url=url, extraction_strategy=strategy)\n    \n            # Parse and print the extracted content\n            extracted_data = json.loads(result.extracted_content)\n            print(json.dumps(extracted_data, indent=2))\n    \n    asyncio.run(main())\n    \n\n#### Use Cases for JsonCssExtractionStrategy\n\n  * Extracting product information from e-commerce websites.\n  * Gathering news articles and their metadata from news portals.\n  * Collecting user reviews and ratings from review websites.\n  * Extracting job listings from job boards.\n\nBy choosing the right extraction strategy, you can effectively extract the\nmost relevant and useful information from web content. Whether you need fast,\naccurate semantic segmentation with `CosineStrategy`, nuanced, instruction-\nbased extraction with `LLMExtractionStrategy`, or precise structured data\nextraction with `JsonCssExtractionStrategy`, Crawl4AI has you covered. Happy\nextracting! 🕵️‍♂️✨\n\nFor more details on schema definitions and advanced extraction strategies,\ncheck out the[Advanced JsonCssExtraction](../advanced_jsoncss_extraction/).\n\n### CosineStrategy\n\n`CosineStrategy` uses hierarchical clustering based on cosine similarity to\ngroup text chunks into meaningful clusters. This method converts each chunk\ninto its embedding and then clusters them to form semantical chunks.\n\n#### When to Use\n\n  * Ideal for fast, accurate semantic segmentation of text.\n  * Perfect for scenarios where LLMs might be overkill or too slow.\n  * Suitable for narrowing down content based on specific queries or keywords.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n  * `semantic_filter` (str, optional): Keywords for filtering relevant documents before clustering. Documents are filtered based on their cosine similarity to the keyword filter embedding. Default is `None`.\n  * `word_count_threshold` (int, optional): Minimum number of words per cluster. Default is `20`.\n  * `max_dist` (float, optional): Maximum cophenetic distance on the dendrogram to form clusters.
